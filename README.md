npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv),
> which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Deploying to the web

### With [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Deploy using GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> This uses [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) dependence.
